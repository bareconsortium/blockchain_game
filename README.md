# blockchain_game

A modern twist on the classic Snake game with an innovative twist of blockchain integration. This project combines the excitement of retro gaming with the transparency and security of blockchain technology.

Key Features:

Classic Gameplay with a Twist: Experience the nostalgia of guiding the snake to collect "food" while avoiding collisions. But here's the twist: the "food" items are interactive ads powered by real-time data through Chainlink Oracles.

Transparent Ad Integration: Advertisers can dynamically insert their content as in-game "food" items. These ads are securely verified by smart contracts, ensuring fairness and transparency in ad placements.

Zilliqa Blockchain Integration: Our game leverages Zilliqa's blockchain technology for secure transactions, scoring records, and enhanced player experiences.

Real-time Notifications: Receive instant updates about blockchain interactions, high scores, and ad-related activities, ensuring an engaging and responsive user experience.

Charitable Impact: By advertising, you're contributing to charitable causes. All profits generated from advertisements go directly towards benefiting players, as they are the ones engaging with the interactive ads. Your gameplay directly supports initiatives for education, health, and community development.

Join us in embracing the future of gaming, where the past meets the present through blockchain innovation. Play, advertise, and make a difference with the blockchain_game!

## Detailed Game Design Document (GDD)

### Concept

"blockchain_game" is a decentralized online game where the objective is to eat as many blocks as possible to win digital assets. Anyone with an authentic digital wallet address, and the willingness to play can enjoy the game. This decentralized online-arcade game establishes a symbiotic relationship between Game Designers and Players, fostering demand for in-game advertising.

### Rewards and Cryptocurrency

Rewards for playing the game include digital assets such as LINK. For payment-to-play, the following cryptocurrencies are supported:

- Chainlink (LINK)

These cryptocurrencies are chosen for their wide acceptance and high liquidity, making them suitable for the NFT arcade's pay-to-play functionality. They will be integrated into the smart contract system to ensure secure and automated pay-to-play and reward transactions.

### Mechanics

- Single player game.
- Player can move the Block-Chain up, down, left, or right to eat blocks.
- Avoid collisions with walls and the player's own chain.
- Eating blocks increases the Block-Chain's length by 1 block.

### Goals

The game's objective is to eat as many blocks as possible. The game has a cap, and challenges exist to encourage players to achieve high scores and enhance user interaction.

### Player Experience Design Template

1. **Load Screen Animation**: Engage users with a visually appealing animation while the game loads.

2. **Welcome Animation**: Use animations to introduce the game and capture players' attention.

3. **Initiate Contract (Start Game Button)**: Place the start game button visibly on the gameboard.

4. **Gameplay**: Design visuals for gameplay, including elements, backgrounds, characters, and more.

5. **Game Over! Screen**: Create a game over screen displaying the player's final score.

6. **Reinitiate Contract (Restart Game Button)**: Include a restart game button for a new game.

### Scilla Smart Contract Optimization

Designing a Scilla smart contract for online-arcade gaming involves optimizing for minimal transaction costs and efficient execution:

- Minimize storage variables to reduce gas costs.
- Reduce conditional statements to lower gas consumption.
- Optimize code by reducing loops, data copying, and function calls.
- Implement a caching mechanism for frequently accessed data.
- Use appropriate data types to minimize gas costs.
- Log contract state changes using events for efficient debugging.
- Consider a fee structure that incentivizes multiple games in one transaction to reduce overall gas costs.

By implementing these optimization strategies, the Scilla smart contract can deliver an efficient and cost-effective gaming experience.
